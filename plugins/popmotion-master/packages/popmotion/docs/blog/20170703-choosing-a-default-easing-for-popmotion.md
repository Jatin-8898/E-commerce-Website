# Choosing the correct default easing for Popmotion

Choosing default values for a library is difficult. Should you be the benefactor/victim of a wider audience:

- These defaults will be used, often unwittingly, by your consumers.
- You can change them only at the risk of breaking other people's stuff.

In a motion engine, these choices manifest themselves in a visual and visceral way. A duration here, a spring tightness there.

This means there's responsibility to choose values intelligently, so that the little patches of the web that use your library benefit from more responsive motion.

As the userbase of Popmotion is relatively small, I've always felt comfortable shirking the shackles of API stability until I finally felt like it had arrived at a the Good Place. Apologies to anyone who's lived that.

Luckily, over the years of wildly oscillating GitHub activity graphs,
there has been one (one) decision that I felt like I got right at the start: Making the `tween` default easing property `easeOut`.

## A brief history of timing

Like many greying front end devs, my first exposure to UI animation was [Greensock's](https://greensock.com) then-ActionScript library, TweenMax. For a platform so disposed to garish show-off loading screen animations, Flash animations were disgusting to hand code unless you were using TweenMax.

And that's largely what we used it for: showy animations. The Flash days were as over-the-top and as divorced from the user's interests as the Amiga demoscene. All you wanted to do was play your cracked version of Worms but first you had to sit through the seizure-inducing cock-prancing of some git in Norwich. At least Flash intros occasionally had a skip button.

![This, but flashing, and scrolling, and waving. Forever](/static/guides/amiga-demoscene.png)

Greensock, in its sunrise years, had the right intentions. It did, and still to this day, has an `easeOut` as default. That's because the author understands, despite our hedonism and heathenism, that animation in UI design **should** be as a result of a user's action. `easeOut` is snappy, and as we'll see later, "snappy" is how we should respond to user actions.

Flash died, and the community collectively denied any involvement.

!["Honestly never heard of it. Like Gordon?"](/static/guides/flash-gordon.jpg)

Then it was all about jQuery. jQuery was incredible for literally **everything**, which in the new world of composable asynchronous micropackages is probably why we again collectively deny any involvement, and why I'm talking about it in the past tense even while it's standing **right there**, watching us.

For me, and maybe for you, the coolest thing about jQuery was `animate`. It was amazing to easily get something resembling movement in humble HTML. Even if it defaulted to `swing` easing, a tepid, muddy `easeInOut` of homeopathic strength.

That easing was coupled with a default duration of `400`ms. Then that was folded into our neanderthal, performance-ignorant tweening of the CPU-choking, layout-breaking `width` and `height` properties. Lethargic animation ruled the internet.

## The problem with `easeInOut`

To arrive at an actual point, the problem with `easeInOut` is that it **feels** incredibly slow. When we [watch videos about the principles of animation](https://vimeo.com/93206523), one of the things we're taught is that objects in motion don't start in motion and they don't stop dead.

They start slow, and end slow.

So that sounds about right, we think, and then we stop thinking, and use `easeInOut` by choice, or a framework like jQuery makes it default, and then everyone uses it, by default, and everything feels sluggish, by default. Why?

## Why

Our eyes and brain are hardwired to detect motion. We've evolved to find that motion distracting. Motion indicates that the present situation has changed, and we need to react if we'd prefer to survive. We **need** motion to be distracting.

When you're scrolling through a website, and a space opens for an advert in the middle of your article, and everything jumps around, and then after a couple of seconds your crap, overpriced "4G" connection finally loads the banner ad, which animates on loop, until you scroll past it, when it then needlessly closes, god I hate Motherboard, your text jumps back up, you think of the poor bastard forced to make it, their hopes, their dreams, their broken dreams - all of those things are distracting.

That motion, the things causing it: They're not imparting useful information, they're not even trying to kill you. So it's annoying.

It's all shit, the user isn't involved in any of this, he's happy about the broken dreams. And yet, `easeInOut` is entirely appropriate, it is the least damaging easing to use for uninstigated animation, it is the right choice.

What does it say about an easing that **this** is a good use case for it?

## It's sometimes okay, I guess

A **very** tiny amount of uninstigated motion is fine in a UI, as long as it correctly indicates that **the situation has changed, and the user needs to react**. A small "new message" dot, probably. Or a notification panel, possibly.

For this kind of animation, an `easeInOut` or `anticipate` is very appropriate because it gives the user a little bit of time to acclimatise to the movement, and it stops quite gently, naturally. It adheres to the principles of animation, these dots and panels now feel a little more real, your UI a little more alive.

It's certainly better than things just flicking around the page without the user understanding what's changed.

## But usually it very much isn't

The **vast majority** of animation in UI is, or should be, user instigated.

For these animations, these interactions, the user already knows that an action has taken place. **They** started the motion, and the situation has changed, and the UI needs to react. The "in" of an `easeIn` or `easeInOut` feels sluggish in this instance because for god's sake hurry up, get on with it.

The energy and momentum of `easeInOut` starts in the virtual reality and stays there. The energy and momentum `easeOut`, conversely, starts in the user's reality and ends in the interface's.

It takes the user's energy, directly from their finger, through the wire or screen, straight into the button, the tooltip, the whatever, and bursts with the maximum energy at that initial moment of contact.

`easeInOut` is barely bothered to get out of bed, like a stupid stroppy teenager who probably doesn't even have a finger. Probably.

A user will feel that difference, even if it's subconscious, even if I have to pretend to myself that deep down they **know**, just to justify the hours of my life I've spent writing (and now writing about) animations.

This is why Greensock comes with `easeOut` by default. It's why [Anime.js](http://animejs.com/) uses a zinger `elasticOut`. And it's why Popmotion uses `easeOut` too.

Whereas, CSS transitions default to the `swing`-alike `ease`, which is exactly as bland as it sounds. Worse, the native Web Animations API uses `linear` easing, which is, frankly, a fucking crime.

## Feel it for yourself

Here's `easeInOut`.

```marksy
<Example template="Ball" id="a">{`
const ball = document.querySelector('#a .ball');
const ballRenderer = styler(ball);

tween({
  to: 300,
  duration: 500,
  ease: easing.easeInOut
}).start((x) => ballRenderer.set('x', x));
`}</Example>
```

Buuuuuuurrrrr. END ME.

Conversely, here's an `easeOut` with the Popmotion default of `300`ms.

```marksy
<Example template="Ball" id="b">{`
const ball = document.querySelector('#b .ball');
const ballRenderer = styler(ball);

tween({
  to: 300,
  ease: easing.easeOut
}).start((x) => ballRenderer.set('x', x));
`}</Example>
```

I. Am. Blushing.

Notice that when you press start on these examples, you're pressing the button yet it's the ball that's moving. Even with this physical disconnect, the first example feels like you're **telling** the ball to move, and then it moves of its own accord. Whereas the second example, you're **making** the ball move, it's using **your** energy.

It makes a difference! Users can tell.

It does. It makes a difference.It does.Userscantellitmakesadifferencepleasemakeadifferenceuserscantell
