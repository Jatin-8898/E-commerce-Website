# Custom transitions

With zero-config animations, it's easy to create snappy and playful animations just by defining poses.

But there's plenty of instances where we want full control over our animation. For this, we can use the `transition` property.

## `transition`

Just like CSS, every pose has a `transition` property. This is a function you can optionally provide that creates a [Popmotion animation](/api) (or `false`, for no animation).

Replace the `props` you added to either the [Pose](https://codepen.io/popmotion/pen/bvqJbV?editors=0010) or [React Pose](https://codepen.io/popmotion/pen/mxmrPZ?editors=0010) playgrounds with the following:

```javascript
const { tween } = popmotion

const props = {
  visible: { opacity: 1 },
  hidden: {
    opacity: 0,
    transition: (props) => tween({ ...props, duration: 1000 })
  }
}
```

As you can see, the animation now runs at `1000`ms:

## `transition` props

This function is run **once, for every value being animated in the current pose**. This allows you to return a different animation for each value.

It's provided a single object, a `props` object. The object contains properties that you can use to decide which animation is being returned for each value.

### Pose-generated `props`

The following props are generated by Pose:

- `from`: The current state of this value
- `to`: The target state defined in the pose
- `velocity`: If a numerical value, the current velocity of the value
- `key`: The name of the current value
- `prevPoseKey`: The name of the pose this value was previously set to

For instance, we can use `key` to return a different animation based on the value being animated. Let's add a `scaleY` property to our poses, and use `key` to change return a different [easing](/api/easing) for it:

```javascript
const { easing, tween } = popmotion

const props = {
  visible: { scaleY: 1, opacity: 1 },
  hidden: {
    scaleY: 0,
    opacity: 0,
    transition: (props) => tween({
      ...props,
      duration: 1000,
      ease: key === 'opacity' ? easing.linear : easing.anticipate
    })
  }
}
```

You're also under no obligation to end the animation on the `to` property. You can do anything with the returned animation.

Set the `.box`'s `opacity` to `1` in the CSS. Now replace our `props` with a new set of poses:

```javascript
const props = {
  initialPose: 'rest',
  rest: { scale: 1 },
  alert: { scale: 1.2 }
}
```

Set the poser or posed component to "alert" and the box will transition to the `scale: 1.2` defined in that pose.

Now we can add a custom `transition` function that will return a `spring` animation with `damping` set to `0`. This will make the animating oscillate around the `to` value indefinitely:

```javascript
const props = {
  rest: { scale: 1 },
  alert: {
    scale: 1.2,
    transition: (props) => spring({
      ...props,
      stiffness: 20,
      damping: 0
    })
  }
}
```

We can add a `setTimeout` function that will set the `boxPoser` to `rest` after any amount of time:

```javascript
setTimeout(() => boxPoser.set('rest'), 2000)
```

Try changing the timeout duration. The box will animate smoothly from any point, even though the "alert" animation didn't end on its `to` value. And because `scale` uses a spring animation by default, it also maintains some of the property's velocity.

### User-generated `props`

This `props` object can also contain variables set by you when the pose changes.

In Pose, `set` accepts an optional second argument of props:

```javascript
poser.set('poseName', { customProp: true })
```

In React Pose, props set on the component are forwarded to the `transition` function:

```javascript
<PosedComponent pose="poseName" customProp={true} />
```

## Next

So far, we've shown how simple it is to animate a single element.

Traditionally, orchestrating animation across multiple elements has been an involved process. In the next tutorial we'll show how with Pose animating many elements is the same as animating just one.
