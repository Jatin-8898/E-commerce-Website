# Dragging

Simplifying interactivity is a core aim of Pose. Currently, it supports dragging and hard drag boundaries, but in the future we'll have elasticated drag boundaries and more.

For now, let's implement dragging, boundaries and apply momentum when a user stops dragging.

For this tutorial you can follow with [vanilla Pose](https://codepen.io/popmotion/pen/RMVKRM?editors=0010) or [React Pose](https://codepen.io/popmotion/pen/zWwNKK?editors=0010).

## `dragging`

Making an element draggable is as simple as setting `draggable: true` in the props:

```javascript
const props = {
  draggable: true
}
```

<CodePen id="OvmWZG" />

`true` sets both axis to draggable, but we can select a single axis to drag on by setting it to `'x'` or `'y'`:

```javascript
const props = {
  draggable: 'x'
}
```

## Drag boundaries

We can add drag boundaries with the `dragBounds` property. It accepts `top`, `left`, `bottom` and/or `right`, measured in pixels or percentages:

```javascript
const props = {
  draggable: 'x',
  dragBounds: { left: -100, right: 100 }
}
```

## `dragEnd` pose

Making an element draggable triggers a new pose when the user stops dragging, `dragEnd`. This can be used like any other pose, which means you can use a custom `transition` function.

For example, we could have the element spring back to the center:

```javascript
const { spring } = popmotion

const props = {
  draggable: true,
  dragEnd: { transition: spring }
}
```

<CodePen id="xWdqLy" />

Or (throw lightly!) we can use [decay](/api/decay) to create momentum scrolling.

```javascript
const { decay } = popmotion

const props = {
  draggable: true,
  dragEnd: { transition: decay }
}
```

## `onChange`

Often, we want to respond to changes in a value. We can use the `onChange` prop to accomplish this.

This object allows us to create a callback for each value we animate:

```javascript
const props = {
  draggable: true,
  dragEnd: { transition: decay },
  onChange: {
    x: x => console.log(x)
  }
}
```

### `onChange` with React

With React, `onChange` callbacks are handled a little differently to vanilla Pose. Instead, we pass them to the posed component itself:

```javascript
<Box onChange={{ x: x => console.log(x) }} />
```

It's important to note that `onChange` can only be defined once, when the component mounts.

## Next

So far we've covered animations and interactions, active stuff. Next, we'll take a look at some values who prefer to sit back, relax, and only change when others do.
